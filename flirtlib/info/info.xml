        <briefdescription>
	 FLIRTLib is a data association library to be used as a front end for graph based mapping, using RANSAC and multi-scale interest point. It implements four 
	 different multi-scale feature detectors and two feature descriptors for 2D range data. It is written in C++ and provides an API reference  (written using 
	 Doxygen) and a set of example binaries to visualize the detector results and the descriptors, as well as perform scan to scan matching.

        <description>
	Local image features are used for a wide range of applications in computer vision and range imaging. While there is a great variety of detector-descriptor 
        combinations for image data and 3D point clouds, there is no general method readily available for 2D range data.
        To this end, we addressed the problem of multi-scale interest points for 2D range data.  Based on large-scale data sets for robot navigation, we defined a 
	set of benchmark experiments as testbed for the comparison of detectors and descriptors for 2D range data.  The data sets have been globally registered by 
	a SLAM algorithm serving as the ground truth. We then developed and compared a number of different detectors and descriptor approaches. We considered four
	multi-scale detectors on the direct range signal, a descriptor based on the idea of occupancy grids and a shape context-based descriptor.
        We finally  proposed  FLIRT  (Fast Laser Interest Region Transform)  as the most powerful detector-descriptor pair,  combining a detector based on a curve 
        approximation of the range signal and a descriptor that encodes occupancy information in a polar region around the interest point.   It was found that the 
        repeatability and precision diagrams have both, similar trends and values than the corresponding plots of detectors and descriptors for image data. 
        
	The library implements the following detectors: range, normal edge, normal blob and curvature. All detectors apply the scale-space theory (see References) 
	to the range data.  The first three detectors apply the theory to the monodimensional signal defined by the laser scanner,  while the last one applies the 
	theory to the continuous geodesic coordinate of the curve that better approximate the point cloud.

	    * Range detector. It finds interest points in scale-space with a blob detector applied on the raw range information in the laser scan.
	    * Normal Edge detector. It finds interest points in scale-space with an edge detector applied on a local approximation of the normal direction.
	    * Normal Blob detector. It finds interest points in scale-space with a blob detector applied on a local approximation of the normal direction.
	    * Curvature detector. It finds interest points using the scale space theory for curves introduced by Unnikrishnan and Hebert.

	The library implements the following descritptors: shape context and beta-grid. 

	    * Shape Context. It implements a local and linear version of the Shape Context introduced by Belongie and Malik.
	    * Beta-Grid. It implements a linear-polar occupancy grid. It extends the Shape Context with the notion of free space.
